# Notes and observations

## Female-dominated vs. male-dominated fields

### Female-dominated fields

3 Converging: geosciences, nutrition, sociology, 

5 Constant: anthropology, ecology, genetics, "microbiology, immunology, and virology", "psychology, general", social sciences not elsewhere classified

2 Diverging: biometry and epidemiology, biosciences not elsewhere classified,

### Male-dominated fields

2 Constant: chemistry, computer sciences

2 Converging: mathematics and applied mathematics, industrial and manufacturing engineering

5 Diverging: physics, civil engineering, electrical engineering, "engineering science, mechanics, and physics", mechanical engineering **(ALL ENGINEERING, except industrial and manufacturing engineering)**

## Connected scatter plots

To convey uneven recruitment, I prefer using connected scatter plots over percentage line charts. If in one year the University gained 100 male and 20 female graduate students, it's possible that the sex ratio does not change. However, in a connected scatter plot, the line would clearly stray further from the parity line.

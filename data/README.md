**Disclaimer: The master data files (any csv file directly in this directory) were [modified slightly](https://github.com/spec-journalism/gss-diversity/commit/def1af012f8ccc68757b2fe3deff74f5eb08c9d1) to make them easier to read with pandas. `/notebooks/pickler.ipynb` will not work if this change is not made to newly downloaded data files.**

# GSS

Guiding question: In Columbia, For every field, what has gender representation looked like in the last twenty years?

## General steps

1. Data collection: Export csv with data you want from [interactive](https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/ids/gss)
2. Data cleaning: Read in that csv to pandas, and format it in a dictionary.
3. Data exploration: Use matplotlib to explore gender representation over the last twenty years for every field (see [subplots](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html))

## TODOs

## Disclaimers

The [master data file](https://github.com/spec-journalism/gss-diversity/blob/master/data/Detailed_Sex_RaceEthnicity.csv) was [modified slightly](https://github.com/spec-journalism/gss-diversity/commit/def1af012f8ccc68757b2fe3deff74f5eb08c9d1) from its original state to make it easier to read with pandas.
